MidiPlayer

A simple Midi file 'player'
Not meant to be a player in a traditional sense, but the software side to a floppy-drive (or similar) based physical device.

The player takes in a midi file, parses it into an intermediary note stage, and then can output using different output modules. The only current module is one that creates a midi file for PoC.
